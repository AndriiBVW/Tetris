# Тетріs

Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird, which moves persistently to the right.

In Tetris, players complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces, which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled. The longer the player can delay this inevitable outcome, the higher their score will be.
